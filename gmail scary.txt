For messages that indicate a blocked sign-in attempt, as long as the from address is  Google <no-reply@accounts.google.com>, they are legitimate. It means that an app that you are using with your Google account is causing the issue.
To resolve this, you can go to the site https://myaccount.google.com/permissions
and review the apps that have permission to your account. Click on the app to remove access for any that you no longer use or do not recognize.

This should resolve the issue, but if you need any assistance or continue receiving the notification, please let me know.
